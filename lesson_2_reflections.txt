What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

When you initialize a repository it creates an hidden .git directory.
This allows you to manage it with Git. You need to initialize a repository if you want to manage it with Git's version control.

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?

The staging area may not necessarily have all the files that the working directory does. It contains the files that you intend to commmit.
The staging area allows you to control what files exactly you intend to include in a commmit. This allows finer grain control over your commit history,
allowing you to maintain the "one logical change per commit" rule.
