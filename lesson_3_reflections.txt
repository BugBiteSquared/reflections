When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

I would use a remote repository if I'm concerned about the losing work on a local repository or if I want to collaborate on a project.
This means pretty much any significant project I plan to work on, even including some toy problems I'm comfortable showing off. 
On that note, my Github page is pretty sparse at the moment due to only recently making it, and working with team members
unfamiliar with version control solutions like Git.
